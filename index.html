				<p>Some penguins have to walk for days or weeks to hit the ocean while their mate remains at the nest, without food, battling weather and those troublesome egg-eating birds. That’s some hardcore dedication, and they’re damn good at it. <span class="strike">CONSTANT VIGILANCE!</span> </p>

The males guard their egg for about 2 months while the female feeds. Adding in time for travel and courtship, it can be as many as 115 days before he can feed again. Emperor males <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Penguin#Courtship_and_breeding">have been known to drop as much as 44lbs (20kg)</a>, or about 45% of their body weight, in that time.

			<p>Antarctic penguins are equipped with exactly what they need to survive: Plenty of fat and feathers to keep them warm (or release heat when they’re too hot. Yes, it does happen sometimes.) Their circulatory system also adjusts to help keep their temperature regulated.</p>
